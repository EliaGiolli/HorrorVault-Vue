## üìÑ Pages Explained

### 1. **HorrorFilms.vue**

- **Intro Section**: Welcomes users and introduces the horror film collection.
- **Film Cards**: Dynamically lists all horror films from `filmsData.js` using the `Card` component.
  - Each card displays:
    - Film title
    - Poster image
    - Director
    - Subgenre
    - Year of publication

#### Example Card Rendering

```vue
<Card v-for="film in horrorFilms" :key="film.id">
  <h2>{{ film.title }}</h2>
  <img :src="film.poster" :alt="'Poster for ' + film.title">
  <p>Director: {{ film.director }}</p>
  <p>Subgenre: {{ film.subgenre }}</p>
  <p>Year: {{ film.year }}</p>
</Card>
```

## üîó Data & API Fetch

### Static Data

Currently, the app uses static data imported from `src/data/filmsData.js`:

```js
import { horrorFilms } from '../data/filmsData.js'
```

This array contains objects for each film, e.g.:

```js
{
  id: 1,
  title: "The Shining",
  director: "Stanley Kubrick",
  subgenre: "Psychological Horror",
  year: 1980,
  poster: "/assets/shining.jpg"
}
```

### API Fetch (If Implemented)

If you plan to fetch data from an external API, you would typically use the `fetch` API or Axios in the `<script setup>` block:

```js
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'

const horrorFilms = ref([])

onMounted(async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/horror-films')
  horrorFilms.value = await response.json()
})
```

- **Where**: Place this logic in your view or a composable.
- **How**: The API should return an array of film objects with the same structure as your static data.
- **Usage**: The template will automatically update to show the fetched films.
